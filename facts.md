# Interesting Facts of the Day of the Week

## [Fact 1: January 1 year N occurs on the same day of the week as January 1 year N + 400.][f1]

Explanation:

In the Gregorian Calendar, over a period of four hundred years, there are 97 leap years and 303 normal years. Each normal year, the day of January 1 advances by one; for each leap year it advances by two.

```text
303 + 97 + 97 = 497 = 7 * 71
```

## [Fact 2: The last day of February, 4/4, 6/6, 8/8, 10/10, and 12/12 all occur on the same day of the week in any year.][f2]

They are called the **Doomsdays**. Here's a table for the Doomsday number.

| Month |  1  |   2   | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |  7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 |
| ----- | --- | ----- | - | - | - | - | -- | - | - | -- | -- | -- |
|  Date | 3/4 | 28/29 | 0 | 4 | 9 | 6 | 11 | 8 | 5 | 10 |  7 | 12 |

Explanation:

It can be proved easily that the distance between any two doomsdays are multiple of 7, so they occurs on the same day of the week.
